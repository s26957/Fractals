**Iterative generating fractals, chaos game - educational help project**

I. How it works
User inputs parameters for transformations which they want to use for drawing a fractal and the probability with which those should be used.
Then, a fractal is drawn based on chaos game - repeating steps of 1. choosing random transformation 2. applying it 3. moving drawig pen to new coordinants.

II. Functions
  1. Drawings fractals based on custom-defined transformation
  2. Saving custom transformations
  3. Uploading predefined trasformations that results in drawing most popular fractals (Sierpinski, Barnsley, Cantor, etc.)
  4. Changing predefined transformations to observe the result
